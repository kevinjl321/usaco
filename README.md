# USACO Solutions (C++ & Java)
A collection of solutions to problems from past USACO contests as well as other problems
I have solved for practice/training purposes.

Some problems I could not solve on my own so algorithms from the editorials were implemented instead.

To run or test the code, see tutorial: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw

# USACO Solutions (C++ & Java)
A collection of solutions to problems from past USACO contests as well as other problems
solved/studied.

Some of the competitions I did not participate in, I just did the problems afterwards for practice.

To configure Visual Studio Code for USACO and other programming competitions, check this out: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw

Note that "template.cpp" is no longer viable as the new USACO competitions use standard I/O. It is still useful for submitting problems for older contests.

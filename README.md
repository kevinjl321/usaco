# USACO Solutions (C++ & Java)
A collection of solutions to problems from past USACO contests as well as other problems
solved/studied.

NOTE: Some of the competitions I did not participate in, I just did the problems afterwards for practice.

To run or test the code or configure VSCode, see tutorial: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw
